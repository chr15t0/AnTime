AnTime is a mobile time management and schedule generator I independently developed for my final thesis. This application was developed to tackle the Directorate of Digitalization and System Integration (Ditgrasi) of USU’s struggle to create a training schedule that satisfies complex constraints (time, place, and human resources). The schedule generation process was done by implementing a Rank-based Ant System Algorithm that was found to be great for finding solutions for NP-Hard Problems such as TSP or Scheduling Problems. This project was proven successful when tested to schedule 30 activities with 5 meeting schedules as constraints. The result shows no overlapping schedules, and no constraints were violated. This project was developed using Kotlin, Android Studio, Firebase Firestore, and Firebase Authentication. This project taught me how to integrate Firebase Authentication for user authentication and Firestore for saving user’s data and schedules. It also tested my logical thinking skills while implementing the Rank-based Ant System Algorithm. This project allows me to utilize and harness the skills and knowledge I have gained from the past four years of College and the Bangkit Program.
